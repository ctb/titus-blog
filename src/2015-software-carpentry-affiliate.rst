We are pleased to announce that the Laboratory for Data Intensive
Biology at UC Davis has joined the Software Carpentry Foundation
as an Affiliate Member for three years, starting in January 2015.

"We've been long-term supporters of Software Carpentry, and Affiliate
status lets us support the Software Carpentry Foundation in a tangible
way," said Dr. C. Titus Brown, the lab director.  "This status also
gives us the opportunity to include Software Carpentry as part of a
larger biological data science training program at UC Davis."

Software Carpentry is a volunteer organisation whose goal is to make
scientists more productive, and their work more reliable, by teaching
them basic computing skills. Founded in 1998, it runs short, intensive
workshops that cover program design, version control, testing, and
task automation. It has taught over 10,000 learners, and primarily
uses a two-day workshop format.

In October 2014, a non-profit Software Carpentry Foundation was
created to act as a governing body for the project, with Dr. Greg
Wilson as the founding Executive Director.  Affiliate status with the
SCF provides preferential access to instructor training as well as
waiving per-workshop fees.

The Laboratory for Data Intensive Biology (DIB) is newly started with
Dr. Brown's move to UC Davis in January 2015.  The lab is in the
Department of Population Health and Reproduction in the School of
Veterinary Medicine, and is part of both the Data Science Initiative
and the Genome Center at UC Davis.  DIB does fundamental and applied
research on making use of the increasing volume and variety of
biological data, and Dr. Brown currently has funding from the NIH, the
USDA, and the Moore Foundation.
