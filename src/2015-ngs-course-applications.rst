Here are some statistics from this year's applications to the
`NGS course <http://bioinformatics.msu.edu/ngs-summer-course-2015>`__.
Briefly, this is a two-week workshop on sequence analysis at the command
line and in the cloud.

The short version is that demand remains high; note that we admit only
24 applicants, so generally < 20%...

====   ====================== ===========================
Year   Number of applications Note
====   ====================== ===========================
2010   33
2011   133
2012   170
2013   210
2014   170                    (shifted the timing to Aug)
2015   155                    (same timing as 2014)
====   ====================== ===========================

The demand is still high, although maybe starting to dip?

Lots of tenure-line faculty feel they need this training...

I should look into "Other"!
