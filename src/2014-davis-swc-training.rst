I am pleased to announce that Dr. Greg Wilson will be giving a two-day
Software Carpentry Instructor Training workshop at UC Davis, January
6-7, 2015.  This will be an in-person version of the instructor
training that Greg runs every quarter; see `my blog post about the
first such instructor training, here
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-swc-toronto-training.html>`__ to get
some of idea of what it's like.  Note that the training is necessary
for those who want to become accredited Software Carpentry or Data
Carpentry instructors.

If you're interested in further information, go subscribe to `this
github issue <https://github.com/ngs-docs/angus/issues/33>`__; we
should have room for a dozen extra people to attend.

NOTE: This workshop is hosted by `my new lab
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-going-to-davis.html>`__, but I am seeking
additional support; drop me a line if you're interested in
co-sponsoring the workshop.

On January 8th, I plan to run a third day of activities.  The three
things I have tentatively planned are,

#. run people through the GitHub Flow process of contributing to a github
   repository, as in `our hackathon <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-khmer-hackathon.html>`__ (also see `our writeup here <http://figshare.com/articles/Channeling_community_contributions_to_scientific_software_a_hackathon_experience/1112541>`__);

#. walk people through our process for generating maintainable
   command-line tutorials, recipes, and protocols (more on that at ABIC);

#. have an open discussion about `what and how to do training in data intensive biology at Davis <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-davis-and-training.html>`__.

This third day of activities is going to be more restricted in
attendance than the first two days, but if you're into teaching
computation and biology and want to see how we're doing things, drop
me a note (t@idyll.org) and I'll see if we can fit you in.
