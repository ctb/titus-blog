I got the following e-mail from a student I know -- lightly edited to
protect the innocent:

   I am at the stage where I am putting together a list of people that
   I want to post-doc with.

   So, a question to you:

   1. How can I find people who do open science?

   2. Say I go for an interview, would it be "polite" to ask them to see if I
   can do open science even if they're not doing it themselves?  Do you have
   any suggestions on how, exactly, to ask?

   The reason why I am asking is because I rarely hear about openly
   doing (or even talking about) science in biomedical fields, outside
   of the standard communication methods (e.g. presenting at a
   meeting). Most of the people in my field seem somewhat conservative
   in this regard. Plus, I really don't want to butt heads with my
   postdoc mentor on this kind of topic.

----

Any advice?  I have some but I'll save it for later so I can incorporate
other people's advice ;).

thanks,

p.s. Yes, I have permission to post this question!
