## Training and teaching

Datacarpentry.org - the home base for Data Carpentry, which runs two day workshops around the world and has an instructor training program that teaches people to teach their materials.

data8.org - the home base for the UC Berkeley "Foundations of Data Science" course. All open/free materials running with open source tools.

## Reading and background

[Influential works in Data-Driven Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08776), a paper by Mark Stalzer and Chris Mentzel, that outlines topics that probably fit within the "data science" field.

[Project Jupyter: Computational Narratives as the Engine of Collaborative Data Science](https://blog.jupyter.org/project-jupyter-computational-narratives-as-the-engine-of-collaborative-data-science-2b5fb94c3c58?gi=f68b10648a2f), a grant proposal by the Jupyter team.

## Some Web sites worth visiting

[mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org) - a Web site for running Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud, for free! [Try out my Monty Hall problem notebook!](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ngs-docs/2018-ggg201b/master?filepath=%2Flab0-monty-hall%2Fmonty-hall.ipynb) (or see [the source](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2018-ggg201b/tree/master/lab0-monty-hall)).

[Media for thinking the unthinkable](https://vimeo.com/67076984) by Bret Victor - an inspiring video lecture that I happened across as I was preparing my talk...
