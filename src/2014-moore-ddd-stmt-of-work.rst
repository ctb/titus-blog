Since `being chosen as a Moore Foundation Data Driven Discovery
Investigator
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-moore-ddd-award.html>`__, I've been
putting together the paperwork at UC Davis to actually receive the
money.  Part of that is putting together a budget and a Statement of
Work to help guide the conversation between me, Davis, and the Moore
Foundation.  Here's what I sent Chris Mentzel at Moore:

----

Title: Infrastructure for Data Intensive Biology

OUTCOME: In support of demonstrating the high level of scientific
impact that data scientists deliver through their focus on
interdisciplinary data-driven research, funds from this award will **be
used to better understand gene function in non-model organisms through
the development of new workflows and better data sharing technology
for large-scale data analysis.**

Research direction 1: Develop and extend protocols for non-model genomic and transcriptomic analysis.

Research direction 2: Integrate and extend existing workflow and data analysis software into a cloud-enabled deployment system with a Web interface for executing protocols.

Research direction 3: Investigate and develop a distributed graph database system and distributed query functionality to support distributed data-driven discovery. (DDDD :)
