I've been thinking a lot about what I want to do at UC Davis, and I
would like to announce the following plans:

#. I hope to write a new and better transcriptome and metagenome
   assemblers.  The current assemblers are hopelessly bad and I think
   we can probably eek out a 1% improvement, at least, by starting
   from scratch.

#. I've been very disappointed with the workflow systems that are out
   there, so for people that want to run our new assembler, we'll be
   packaging that with a new workflow management system.

#. We'll also be developing a new Web site for running analyses of biological
   data.  Galaxy may have market penetration, but I really dislike their
   default CSS, and I think my lab can probably do a better job if we start
   from scratch.

#. Needless to say, I'll need my own physical cloud hardware to run it
   all.  So I'm planning a considerable expansion of our lab's
   cluster.  I think we can probably make a big impact by writing our
   own virtualization management software, too; the existing systems
   are written by amateurs like Amazon and OpenStack, after all!

The bad news is that after some serious consideration, I have decided
not to invest in a new mapping program; on top of the above it's a bit
too much.  I think I trust Heng Li's bwa, for now; we may revisit in a
few months.

I will be seeking large scale NSF, NIH, USDA, and DOE funding for the
above.  Let me know if you want to sign on!
