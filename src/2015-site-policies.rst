This version of the site policy was posted in Oct 2015 and applies
going forward from then.  I'll provide an updated link whenever I
update the policy.

The text was lifted from Captain Awkward's site policy at the URL
http://captainawkward.com/site-policies-and-faqs/ on Oct 19, 2015, and
then modified (significantly) from there.

I'm open to suggestions for additions and removals; please post them
in comments.  However, this set of policies stands until I change them -
thanks for abiding by them!

Mission Statement
-----------------

The goal of this posting and commenting policy is to help move my
blogspace towards being a more participatory and friendly space.

Much of the value I find in writing blog posts comes from the
responses and feedback I receive on the blog posts, and ensuing
conversations. This, in turn, depends on people being willing to
engage in discussions openly, honestly, and in good faith.  The
policy below is my current best effort towards defining a policy
that encourages an atmosphere supportive of this behavior.

I have so far only deleted about 5 non-spam comments in the entire
~decade of this blog, so this policy is more to ensure the tone
than in reaction to any particular misbehavior.

Copyright and License
---------------------

I own the copyright to all of my writing. Guest bloggers retain their
own copyright. Quote all of us freely!  Link & attribute always!

All writings posted on this blog are posted under `CC0
<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.txt>`__
unless listed otherwise at the top or bottom of the post.  `Read more
about CC0. <https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0>`__.

Questions
---------

By posting your comments to the blog you are granting me the right, in
perpetuity, to use, quote, alter, and/or display those questions and
comments however I see fit both for commercial and non-commercial
distribution. If this concerns you, use a pseudonym and remove
identifying details before you send, or simply post a link to your own
blog.  Alterations will rarely be made and will always be obvious; see
`this, for example
<http://sarah.thesharps.us/2015/10/05/closing-a-door/#comment-147828>`__.

I do not share your personal email address or identity, with one
exception: People who threaten or harass me or other posters will have
their names, emails, and IP addresses shared with their internet
service providers and, if necessary, law enforcement.

Comments Policy
---------------

We moderate things in these here parts. Not every point of view
deserves to be heard. Unmoderated spaces tend to be full of jerks.

Anonymous posting is allowed. Using a consistent identity is encouraged.

Your comments will theoretically show up immediately, though the spam
filter may eat legitimate comments, even by regular posters.  Alert me
via e-mail at t@idyll.org if one of your comments doesn't appear.

Of course, sometimes comments don't show up because I delete
them. This is a dictatorship, and I can delete any comment at any time
for any reason, and I have no time for rules lawyers. There may not be
a warning or explanation of why your comment was deleted.

A non-comprehensive list of some common reasons comments are deleted:

- You're derailing a thread.

- The discussion has become uncivil and has devolved into personal
  insults, threats, advocating violence, or turned into a pile-on.

- Sarcasm, curse words, gentle mocking, criticism and vehement
  disagreement are generally allowed, as long as the overall spirit is
  constructive and in good faith.

- You're otherwise being useless, uninformative, or destructive.

Having your comment deleted or being asked to stop commenting in a
particular thread or to move on from a topic of discussion is IN NO
WAY an invitation for you to send me lengthy emails detailing your
thoughts. If I wanted to read Your Thoughts I would have let you keep
posting them.

You can always reach me at t@idyll.org or on Twitter at @ctitusbrown.
