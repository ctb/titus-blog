The other day I was contacted by someone whose student wants to attend
`the MSU NGS course in 2015
<http://bioinformatics.msu.edu/ngs-summer-course-2015>`__, because
they are interested in learning how to data integration with (among
other things) metagenome data.  My response was "we don't cover that
in the course", which isn't very helpful ;).

So, I went hunting, and got the following list of metagenome relevant
workshops from a program manager. Note that I asked them to cast a
broad net, so this goes far beyond "mere" computational analysis of
environmental microbes and their functional -- but it should be pretty
inclusive of what's out there.  If I'm missing something relevant,
please let me know!

`JGI 2015 workshops <http://usermeeting.jgi.doe.gov/2015-workshops/>`__
- fungal genomics, genomic technologies, KBase, sample QC, and
synthetic biology.  (Ongoing now, but keep an eye out for next year.)

`QIIME workshops <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qiime-forum/udclCnZxoYo>`__, ~monthly and/or by invitation.

`The International GeoBiology workshop series
<http://gsageobiology.blogspot.com/2014/11/geobiology-2015-summer-workshop.html>`__,
application deadline in February - keep an eye out for next year.
(This is the workshop I need/want to attend myself, so I can learn
more biogeochemistry!)

`Bigelow Third Microbial Single Cell Genomics Workshop <https://scgc.bigelow.org/education/#br=education_workshop_2015>`__, in June - deadline Mar 29th!!

`iMicrobe workshops <http://imicrobe.us/training-activities/upcoming-imicrobe-workshops/>`__ at ASM this year - see `Workshop WS18 <http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewSession.aspx?mID=1668&sKey=44cd9b69-6938-4e54-8bc0-81f3d16aad18&mKey=%7b224BAD71-94EA-4FA5-8DF3-F4087BDC3625%7d>`__.  Note, registration deadline Mar 30th!!

`MBL STAMPS <http://www.mbl.edu/education/special-topics-courses/strategies-and-techniques-for-analyzing-microbial-population-structures/>`__ (Applications closed for 2015)

`MBL Microbial Diversity <http://www.mbl.edu/education/summer-courses/microbial-diversity/>`__ (applications closed for 2015) - the course is looking
interesting this year, with some focus on intersections between sequencing
and good ol' fashioned physiology/biogeochemistry.

`EDAMAME <http://edamame-course.org/>`__ (applications closed for
2015) - mostly focused on microbial ecology.

My only frustration with this list is that it seems like there's very
little out there that really digs into the bioinformatics of shotgun
metagenomics and biogeochemistry - the MicDiv course at MBL may well
dip a good portion of a leg into this pond, and I'll find out more
this year because I'm participating in it.  But that's it.  Am I
wrong?
