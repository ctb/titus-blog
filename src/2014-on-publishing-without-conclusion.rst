Here's an excerpt from an e-mail to a student whose committee I'm on;
they were asking me about a comment their advisor had made that they
shouldn't put a result in a paper because "It'll confuse the
reviewer."

   One thing to keep in mind is that communicating the results _is_
   important.  "It'll confuse the reviewer" is not always shorthand for
   "well, it's true but we can't say it because it's too confusing",
   which is how I think you're interpreting your advisor's comment; it
   is also shorthand for "well, we don't really have the depth of
   data/information to understand why the result is this way, so
   there's something more complicated going on, but we can't talk about
   it because we don't understand it ourselves."  These can lead to the
   most productive bits of a project, if followed up (but it takes a
   lot of time to do so...)

Their response:

   I'm curious, however, if we don't understand what's going on
   ourselves, shouldn't that be all the more reason to publish
   something? Because then other people with more knowledge can read
   it and they may know what's going on? Or at least help us?

And my response:

Well, that's definitely not how it works.  Let me see if I can think of
some reasons why...

First, it's much easier to get confused than it is to fight your way
out of confusion - and you usually learn something in the process,
obviously.  So you have a lot more people who are confused than have
learned something, and the latter is considered more interesting and
worthy of communication than the former.

Second, writing papers is a lot of work and takes a lot of time.  If
you're confused (and hence probably wrong about any conclusions) it's
probably not worth the effort...

Third, reading papers is also a lot of work!  Most papers are never
read seriously by anyone other than the reviewers.  So doubling or
tripling the number of papers to include confusing or inconclusive
data would probably not be helpful.

Fourth, most conclusions require multiple lines of evidence, most
which are often not developed until you have at least some solid
hypotheses about why you're seeing what you're seeing from one line of
evidence.  So a lot of those pubs would be wrong.

Fifth, failure is frequently underdetermined -- that is, we may have
wrong or incorrect results and not know or know why.  It's rarely
worth chasing down exactly why something didn't work unless it doesn't
work reproducibly and it's critical and important to your results.

That having been said, there's a movement to make publishing data
easier and bring data citations into standard practice, which I think
is partly targeted at the same problem you're asking about.

What am I missing?
