Here is a links roundup and some scattered thoughts on the recent
meeting on "the next five years of data science at the NIH"; this
meeting was hosted by Phil Bourne, the new Associate Director
for Data Science at the NIH.

Before I go any further, let me make it clear that I do not speak in
any way, shape or form for the NIH, or for Phil Bourne, or anyone
else other than myself!

Introduction and commentary:

Phil Bourne took on the role of Associate Director for Data Science at
the NIH in March 2014, with the mission of `"changing the culture of
the NIH"
<http://pebourne.wordpress.com/2014/05/17/ten-weeks-as-adds/>`__ with
respect to data science.  The `#ADDSup meeting
<http://bd2k.nih.gov/addsup_meeting.html>`__ was convened on September
3rd with about 50 people attending, after a sauna-like dinner party at
Phil's house.  (One highlight was `the NIH director, Francis Collins,
leading a data science singalong/kumbaya session
<https://twitter.com/mike_schatz/status/506963533645746176>`__.  I kid
you not.)  The meeting was incredibly diverse, with a range of
academic faculty attending along with representatives from funders,
tech companies, biotech, and publishers/data infrastructure folk.

It's very hard to summarize the discussion in any meaningful way, but
`notes were taken throughout the meeting <@@>`__ if you're interested.
I should also note that (like the previous ADDS @@meeting on XX)
tweeting was encouraged with the hashtag #ADDSup -- `here's the
storify <https://storify.com/ctitusbrown/nih-addsup-meeting>`__.

I ended up co-leading the training breakout session with Michelle Dunn
(NIH), and I am writing a blog post on that separately.

Some fragmented thoughts.
-------------------------

Again, all opinions my own :).

It's on us.  The NIH can fund things, and mandate things, but cannot
_do_ all that much.  If you want biomedical data science to advance, figure
out what needs to be done and talk to Phil to propose it.

Two overwhelming impressions: the NIH moves very slowly.  And the NIH has
an awful lot of money.

Nobody in the academic community is interested in computational
infrastructure building, unless there's a lot of money involved, in
which case we will do it badly (closed source, monolithic
architecture, closed data, etc.) Contractors would love to do it for
us, but the odds `are poor <https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/>`__.  There may
be exceptions but it was hard to think of any extramural
infrastructure project that had, long term, met community
expectations and been sustainable (counter-examples in comments, please!)

Very few people in the biomedical community are particularly
interested in training, either, although they will feign interest if
it supports their graduate students in doing research (see: T-32s).

Because of this, the NIH (and the ADDS more specifically) is left
`carrying water with a sieve
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughters_of_Danaus>`__.  Data science
depends critically on software, data sharing, computational
infrastructure, and training.

Open was missing.  (Geoffrey Bilder pointed this out to me midway
through the morning.)  That having been said, most of the meeting
attendees clearly "got it", but oops.
