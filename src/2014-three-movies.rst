Here are three movies that I can recommend, starting with the best.

`Jiro Dreams of Sushi
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/?ref_=nv_sr_1>`__ - a great movie about
the pursuit of perfection, one slice of fish at a time.  Truly inspiring.
Software engineers and scientists will recognize and identify with
Jiro's aspirations.

`The Angels' Share <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924394/>`__ - a fun, laid
back movie about a scotch whisky caper.  Family fun.  Plus the lead
male character is just plain cute!

`Somm <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2204371/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1>`__ - a somewhat
intense movie about preparing for the Master Sommelier exam.  I was hoping
it would be another Jiro Dreams of Sushi, but instead it was much more about
competition and study.  On that front, anyone who has done a PhD will be 
a bit amused about the statements of hard labor - sure, it's more intense,
but for a shorter period of time.  Of the three, Somm was my least favorite,
but it was still *very* good.

I'm also halfway through two more movies that I hope to finish soon:

`Chef <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2883512/>`__ - Jon Favreau moves from being
a restaurant chef to running a food truck.  Great chemistry, good characters,
delicious-looking food.

`To Be Takei <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2174896/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1>`__ a
*surprisingly* engrossing movie about George Takei's life and career.
