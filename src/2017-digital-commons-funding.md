# Part I -- Sustainability and Funding

## Funding FLOSS contributions

### Individual contributors

Sustainability of Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) has been an ongoing subject of concern.
Earlier this year (2017), [Sustain](https://sustainoss.org/) released a practical report
on the topic, sharing findings and recommendations pertaining to the sustainability of FLOSS
[[Nickolls, 2017](#nickolls:sustain:2017)].
The authors of this report, also known as the [Sustainers](https://github.com/orgs/sustainers/people),
use the term 'FOSS' and, more often, 'OSS.'
We prefer using the term 'FLOSS' to express neutrality [[Stallman, 2013](#rms:floss:2013)].

At the lowest level, FLOSS consists of lines of code contributed by individuals.
The latter contribute either voluntarily or because they are paid to do so
[[Schweik, 2011](#hess:ostrom:chapter10:2011)].
Some organizations, whether for-profit or not-for-profit, hire people to work on FLOSS projects,
either part-time or full-time. To quote the Sustainers,
"contributions are often made on the basis of immediate and individual needs."
And so is the funding of these contributions, from a standpoint where we equate a contribution with its funding:
That is, a contribution would not have landed, had it not been [funded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding)
somehow, whether directly or indirectly, whether in the form of money or time.

This individual-centric perspective makes funding, if not sustainability, a non-issue.
It is only good at answering, as an individual, the all-too-common question "How do you make money working on FLOSS?"
We consider that sustainability includes, but is not restricted to, funding.
Indeed, what if you have funding, but no talent existing or available to take advantage of it?
Now, we may ask the holistic question: Isn't a FLOSS project more than the sum of its individual contributions?

### Collective projects

FLOSS projects which see [communities of practice](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/belonging/)
emerge and organize around them are definitely much more.
An example we cherish would be [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), a Python-based ecosystem for
scientific computing.
Interactions between members of these communities create value, knowledge, and culture.
These members do not have to be code contributors; they may be end users, power users, or contributors
in a broader sense. Remarkably, the [yt project](http://yt-project.org/) has pushed the definition
of its "members" (yt is a Python package for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional scientific data):
Quoting [[Turk, 2016](#turk:contrib:2016)],
"yt has a model in place for recognizing contributions that go beyond code."

So, can we grasp this collective dimension? We sense that sustainability should be a concern
shared throughout the community.
When, additionally, whole segments of technological, cultural, educational, and economic activities rely on
FLOSS projects, we agree with the Sustainers that the concern for sustainability (including funding) should be
shared by "stakeholders" who are many and diverse, far beyond the small circle of (code) contributors.
The Sustainers call this key subset of FLOSS our "essential digital infrastructure."
Further, they identify it as a "public good."
For each piece of this infrastructure, the circle of contributors is indeed very small
with respect to its end-user base, made up of "consumers" or "users"
[[Nickolls, 2017](#nickolls:sustain:2017)].

Although the Sustainers link to Elinor Ostrom's
["8 Principles for Managing A Commmons [sic]"](http://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons#sthash.4sTczIZS.dpbs)
when recommending good governance, we argue that their report is a missed opportunity
for leveraging the concept of Commons.
In the following, we explain why we care about viewing FLOSS as a digital commons
(rather than a public good).
We note that other digital (information, knowledge) commons have been approached as
public goods. One example would be information acquisition, as studied by
[[Ramachandran and Chaintreau, 2015](#ramachandran:econ:2015)].
They also report very low ratios of "contributors" to "consumers,"
falling within a production/consumption view.

## Bringing the Commons into play

### They say FLOSS is a digital commons

Historically, the Commons have described natural resources that were shared
within a community---not only as a matter of fact, but through *intentional rules*
and *collective self-management* which ensured their sustainability and fair access
[[Maurel, 2016](#calimaq:tragedie:2016)].
As more and more commons were enclosed and sacrificed to private interests
(including that of the State), they all but disappeared from the official economic discourse.
Instead, the discussion narrowed down to the private/public dichotomy.
In that paradigm, "public" goods merely qualified what could not (at the time) be realistically
privatized, such as air or water. They were described in contrast to private goods,
as non-rivalrous and non-excludable [[Hess and Ostrom, 2011a](#hess:ostrom:chapter1:2011)].

The concept of Commons reappeared with the rise of environmental concerns
[[Bollier, 2011](#hess:ostrom:chapter2:2011)] as well as the development of technologies,
which suddenly enabled "the capture of what were once free and open public goods"
[[Hess and Ostrom, 2011a](#hess:ostrom:chapter1:2011)].
In a somewhat similar way, knowledge has long been able to straddle the ambiguous border
between private and public: the necessity of print grounding it in the private property realm,
while the [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain)
materialized its non-rivalrous, non-excludable nature.

The Internet and the advent of the digital era have changed this situation.
Once the limitations inherent to print are gone, the complex status of knowledge is revealed.
Defining it as a commons is an attempt to grasp and honor this complexity.
Indeed, the term "Commons" translates a desire to move away and beyond the simplistic understanding
of private vs public. By speaking of commons, its advocates seek to build a new framework
for analysis, which integrates the philosophical, political, and social dimensions
along with the traditional, market-centred economic one
[[Bollier, 2011](#hess:ostrom:chapter2:2011)].

### How is the collective dimension enforced?

This year, we [celebrated](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/help-the-fsf-share-free-software-licenses-with-the-world)
the 10th anniversary of the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3).
It is one of the most popular [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) licenses.
To remain neutral, we wish we could use the term 'FLOSS license' to mean any software license approved by
both the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/) and the
[Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/).
Free Software licenses are *tools* designed to safeguard and advance the freedom of software users.
Indeed, user freedom is the ultimate motivation underlying Free Software. But, since it is not that of
[Open Source](https://opensource.org/about), we cannot casually replace 'Free Software' with 'FLOSS'
in our second-to-last sentence.

What we can highlight is that FLOSS licenses grant *individual* freedoms. There is no built-in mechanism
to account for a community. The sense of community is typically derived from the practice of sharing
(allowed by FLOSS licensing), in-person or remote participation in events (conferences, hackathons, etc.),
and collaboration on certain contributions (possibly event organization, project maintenance, etc.).
We can describe FLOSS as pro-sharing, alongside other movements such as
[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) or
[Open Science](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2016-what-is-open-science.html).
We note that the concern for sharing has been at the heart of Free Software since the very beginning
[[Stallman, 1983](#rms:sharing:1983)].

At the end of the day, distribution and dissemination are one-way ideas. They do not bear on collective
responsibility. Still, we recognize that
[copyleft](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html)---and the related
[ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) offered by Creative Commons
licenses---represent a means to extend some responsibility to all community members.
Therefore, we hypothesize that, even though copyleft and related tools *do* serve the project
of building digital commons, they might not be sufficient. And, although FLOSS has been a great source
of inspiration to other digital commons [[Laurent, 2012](#laurent:reconstruction:2010)],
the FLOSS way does not have to be the only way to the digital Commons.

Generally, most of Commons literature seems to present copyright enclosure
as the one big threat to the digital Commons.
Since digital knowledge is in essence non-rivalrous, there is a presumption that Hardin's famous
"tragedy of commons"[^1] does not apply [[Hess and Ostrom, 2011a](#hess:ostrom:chapter1:2011)].
In fact, the opposite is considered more likely to be true: "the tragedy of the anticommons (...)
lies in the potential underuse of scarce scientific resources caused by excessive
intellectual property rights and overpatenting in biomedical research"
[[Hess and Ostrom, 2011a](#hess:ostrom:chapter1:2011)].
As a reaction, commons-oriented initiatives tend to overemphasize accessibility, to the expense of
sustainability and governance---as if these concerns ranked second in the definition of commons.

[^1]: The tragedy of commons describes the overexploitation or free-riding that lead to a
shared resource's destruction.

## Issues, solutions, and questions

### A critical take on the priorities put forward for these commons

Commons movements deemed successful include FLOSS, Open Access (OA), or
[free culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-culture_movement).
Why does their focus on free access and use fall short?
Mostly because they reflect only the authors' or maintainers' intentions,
with little regard for or feedback from the other stakeholders' needs.
First of all, the very definitions of what constitutes 'freedom' (in FLOSS and
free culture) or 'open access' (in eponymous OA) are subject to a cultural bias.
Open Access, for instance, operates a hierarchy between so-called barriers.
While the removal of some (price and permission) is a compulsory prerequisite
to be labelled OA, others ("handicap access," "connectivity," language, etc.), arguably harder
obstacles to overcome, are merely acknowledged as works in progress
[[Suber, 2011](#hess:ostrom:chapter7:2011)].

This helps us see "free and unfettered access" [[Hess and Ostrom, 2011a](#hess:ostrom:chapter1:2011)]
as a relative concept, and the set of criteria which determine it as mere guidelines,
rather than objective conditions. In this light, we would like to argue for a more
comprehensive view of "accessibility." If we are to treat digital Commons as *commons*,
then we may need to do more (or less, depending) than giving up privileges
traditionally associated with copyright---a privilege unto itself, ironically!
We want to find whatever specific provisions are most likely to serve and engage the community.
Yet the 'free/open' argument, insofar as it is arbitrary and partial,
necessarily promotes the concerns of some over those of others.

Here is an example of different interests conflicting.
In his contribution on OA to book [[Hess and Ostrom, 2011b](#hess:ostrom:knowledge:2011)],
Suber posits that the concept of open access can be extended to
royalty-producing literature [[Suber, 2011](#hess:ostrom:chapter7:2011)].
Yet the focus on eliminating the "price barrier" creates a contention. His
argument that OA does not adversely affect sales is based on the assumption
that people do not read whole books
in electronic format---a surprising opinion, which seems irrevocably outdated. Moreover,
if maximum dissemination is the goal, then distribution and searchability are more important
factors than price---or rather, lack thereof. In many fields where traditional sales channels
are still the norm, putting a price on something---even a symbolic one---remains
the best guarantee of effectively *sharing* one's work.

As a matter of fact, in the chapter that follows Suber's, Ghosh argues that
a well-regulated marketplace can help realize the process of exchange,
which is crucial to the Commons [[Ghosh, 2011](#hess:ostrom:chapter8:2011)].
This does not negate Suber's defense of scholars' "insulation from the market",
but it does put it into perspective.
