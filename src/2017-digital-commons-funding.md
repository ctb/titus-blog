# Part I -- Sustainability and Funding

## Funding FLOSS contributions

### Individual contributors

Sustainability of Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) has been an ongoing subject of concern.
Earlier this year (2017), [Sustain](https://sustainoss.org/) released a practical report
on the topic, sharing findings and recommendations pertaining to the sustainability of FLOSS
[[Nickolls, 2017](#nickolls:sustain:2017)].
The authors of this report, also known as the [Sustainers](https://github.com/orgs/sustainers/people),
use the term 'FOSS' and, more often, 'OSS.'
We prefer using the term 'FLOSS' to express neutrality [[Stallman, 2013](#rms:floss:2013)].

At the lowest level, FLOSS consists of lines of code contributed by individuals.
The latter contribute either voluntarily or because they are paid to do so
[[Schweik, 2011](#hess:ostrom:chapter10:2011)].
Some organizations, whether for-profit or not-for-profit, hire people to work on FLOSS projects,
either part-time or full-time. To quote the Sustainers,
"contributions are often made on the basis of immediate and individual needs."
And so is the funding of these contributions, from a standpoint where we equate a contribution with its funding:
That is, a contribution would not have landed, had it not been [funded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding)
somehow, whether directly or indirectly, whether in the form of money or time.

This individual-centric perspective makes funding, if not sustainability, a non-issue.
It is only good at answering, as an individual, the all-too-common question "How do you make money working on FLOSS?"
We consider that sustainability includes, but is not restricted to, funding.
Indeed, what if you have funding, but no talent existing or available to take advantage of it?
Now, we may ask the holistic question: Is a FLOSS project not more than the sum of its individual contributions?
