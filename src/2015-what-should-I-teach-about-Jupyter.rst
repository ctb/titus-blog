What are the most concretely useful, interesting, awesome or neat things
about Project Jupyter?

Over here at the `Lab for Data Intensive Biology
<ivory.idyll.org/lab/>`__, we're putting on `a workshop on Project
Jupyter notebooks
<http://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/2015-11-19-ipython-jupyter.html>`__
(the notebook system formerly known as IPython Notebook).  This will
be a two-day hands-on workshop, `Carpentry-style
<http://software-carpentry.org>`__, with the goal of introducing
students to the concept and practice of notebook-based data narratives.
We also want to showcase the technology and ecosystem a bit.

This puts me in a bit of a bind, because while I am strong proponent
of IPython Notebook for `reproducibility
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/replication-i.html>`__ and `teaching
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/teaching-with-ipynb-2.html>`__, I don't
have an awful lot of experience with anything beyond the default
Python kernel and Notebook interface.

So my question to the blogosphere: what, beyond the basics, would you
suggest demonstrating to people? Here is the menu from which I am
planning to choose 5-6 topics and demos - suggestions and pointers welcome!
(Note that I'm not looking for particular *notebooks* but rather demonstrations
and concepts that show off the possibilities!)

* sharing and displaying notebooks via github;

* multiple language kernels (e.g. R in Jupyter Notebooks);

* plugin architecture and plugins (e.g. nbgrader; what else?)

* JavaScript interaction (d3.js demos, etc.);

* going from notebooks to publications;

* JupyterHub

* (maybe?) running within Docker: https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/datascience-notebook

Additional suggestions? Specific pointers?
