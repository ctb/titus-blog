Summary: How do you grow community? Slowly and carefully.

For the last three months I've been knee-deep (neck deep? [thoroughly underwater?](https://twitter.com/VivienBonazzi/status/880826121327181825)) in the [#CommonsPilot project](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-commonspilot-kickoff.html), where I have been funded to take on a community coordinating role.

Someone asked today about how my coordination approach dovetails with the immense complexity of the project, and I put together the following answer, which I liked, and am now sharing with y'all.

---

I am trying to use the following process:

* put in place some loose guidelines (we'll be using this platform for e-mail, that project for documents, etc.);

* define a community code of conduct, and start things off the way you want to continue with communication;

* devise some simple on-boarding to connect people with guidelines;

* watch carefully to see what communication avenues are actually being used / work well (slack has been a success, google calendar... not so much); fine tune accordingly (we're now using [groups.io](http://groups.io) for both mailing lists and calendars);

* then, observe & extract the emergent ["Desire Paths"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) and bring them into the on-boarding docs ;

* layer more structure on as need becomes apparent, but don't do it too early, because each layer of structure acts as a straitjacket on the project and limits flexibility and adaptation;

* use training and in-person / 1-1 meetings to inculcate culture and process;

* iterate!

This process has emerged from my participation in open source projects over the last 30 years, as well as from watching Greg Wilson grow Software Carpentry from scratch over a decade. It is as different from the way academics think about building collaborations as the Carpentry teaching method is from ["sage on a stage"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sage_on_the_stage)-style teaching :).

p.s. I just started taking scuba lessons (PADI Open Water cert), which may have been a subconscious reaction to this #CommonsPilot thing... "breathe deeply and slowly. don't panic. and when your air runs out? bail to the surface." :)
