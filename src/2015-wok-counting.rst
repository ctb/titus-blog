`De Bruijn graph alignment
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-wok-error-correction.html>`__ should
also be useful for exploring concepts in transcriptomics/mRNAseq
expression.  As with `variant calling
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-wok-variant-calling.html>`__
graphalign can also be used to avoid the mapping step in
quantification; and, again, as with the variant calling approach, we
can do so by aligning our reference sequences to the graph rather than
the reads to the reference sequences.

The basic concept here is that you build a (non-abundance-normalized)
De Bruijn graph from the reads, and then align transcripts or genomic
regions to the graph and get the k-mer counts across the alignment.
This is nice because it gives you a few options for dealing with
multimapping issues as well as variation across the reference.  You
can also make use of the variant calling code to account for certain
types of genomic/transcriptomic variation and potentially address
allelic bias issues.

Given the existence of `Sailfish/Salmon
<http://nextgenseek.com/2014/04/sailfish-alignment-free-isoform-quantification-from-rna-seq-reads/>`__
and the recent posting of `Kallisto
<https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/near-optimal-rna-seq-quantification-with-kallisto/>`__,
I don't want to be disingenuous and pretend that this is any way a
novel idea!  It's been clear for a long time that using De Bruijn
graphs in RNAseq quantification is a worthwhile idea.  Also, whenever
someone uses k-mers to do something in bioinformatics, there's an
overlap with De Bruijn graph concepts (...pun intended).

What we like about the graphalign code in connection with
transcriptomics is that it makes a surprisingly wide array of things
easy to do.  By eliminating or at least downgrading the "noisiness" of
queries into graphs, we can ask all sorts of questions, quickly, about
read counts, graph structure, isoforms, etc.  Moreover, by building
the graph with `error corrected reads
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-wok-error-correction.html>`__, the
counts should in theory become more accurate.  (Note that this does have the
potential for biasing against low-abundance isoforms because
low-coverage reads can't be error corrected.)

For one simple example of the possibilities, let's compare mapping
counts (bowtie2) against transcript graph counts from the graph
(khmer) for a small subset of a mouse mRNAseq dataset.  We measure
transcript graph counts here by walking along the transcript in the
graph and averaging over k-mer counts along the path.  This is
implicitly a multimapping approach; to get results comparable to
bowtie2's default parameters (which random-map), we divide out the
number of transcripts in which each k-mer appears (see
`count-median-norm.py
<https://github.com/dib-lab/2015-khmer-wok3-counting/blob/master/count-median-norm.py>`__,
'counts' vs 'counts2').

   Figure 1: Dumb k-mer counting (x axis) vs dumb mapping (y axis)

This graph shows some obvious basic level of correlation, but it's not
great.  What happens if we use corrected mRNAseq reads (`built using
graphalign
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-wok-error-correction.html>`__)?

   Figure 2: Dumb k-mer counting on error corrected reads (x axis) vs dumb mapping (y axis)

This looks better - the correlation is about the same, but when we
inspect individual counts, they have moved further to the right,
indicating (hopefully) greater sensitivity.  This is to be expected -
error correction is collapsing k-mers onto the paths we're traversing,
increasing the abundance of each path on average.

What happens if we now *align* the transcripts to the graph built from
the error corrected reads?

   Figure 2: Graphalign path counting on error corrected reads (x axis) vs dumb mapping (y axis)

Again, we see mildly greater sensitivity, due to "correcting"
transcripts that may differ only by a base or two.  But we also see
increased counts above the main correlation, especially above the
branch of counts at x = 0 (poor graph coverage) but with high mapping
coverage - what gives?  Inspection reveals that these are reads with
high mapping coverage but little to no graph alignment.  Essentially,
the graph alignment is getting trapped in a local region.  There are
at least two overlapping reasons for this -- first, we're using the
single seed/local alignment approach (see `error correction
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-wok-error-correction.html>`__)
rather than the more generous `multiseed alignment
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-wok-variant-calling.html>`__, and so
if the starting point for graph alignment is poorly chosen, we get
trapped into a short alignment.  Second, in all of these cases, the
transcript *isn't completely covered* by reads, a common occurrence
due to both low coverage data as well as incomplete transcriptomes.

In this specific case, the effect is largely due to low coverage;
if you drop the coverage further, it's even more exacerbated.

Two side notes here -- first, graphalign will align to low coverage
(untrusted) regions of the graph if it has to, although the algorithm
will pick trusted k-mers when it can.  As such it avoids the common
assembler problem of only recovering high abundance paths.

And second, *no one should use this code for counting.* This is not
even a proof of concept, but rather an attempt to see how well mapping
and graph counting fit with an intentionally simplistic approach.

Isoform structure and expression
--------------------------------

Another set of use cases worth thinking about is looking at isoform
structure and expression across data sets.  Currently we are somewhat
at the mercy of our reference transcriptome, unless we re-run de novo
assembly every time we get a new data set.  Since we don't do this,
for some model systems (especially emerging model organisms) isoform
families may or may not correspond well to the information in the
individual samples.  This leads to strange-looking situations where
specific transcripts have high coverage in one region and low coverage
in another (see `SAMmate <http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3619>`__ for a
good overview of this problem.)

Consider the situation where a gene with four exons, 1-2-3-4,
expresses isoform 1-2-4 in tissue A, but expresses 1-3-4 in tissue B.
If the transcriptome is built only from data from tissue A, then when
we map reads from tissue B to the transcriptome, exon 2 will have no
coverage and counts from exon 3 will (still) be missing.  This can
lead to poor sensitivity in detecting low-expressed genes, weird
differential splicing results, and other scientific mayhem.

(Incidentally, it should be clear from this discussion that it's kind
of insane to build "a transcriptome" once - what we really want do is
build a graph of all relevant RNAseq data where the paths and counts
are labeled with information about the source sample.  If only we had
a way of efficiently labeling our graphs in khmer! Alas, alack!)

With graph alignment approaches, we can short-circuit the currently
common ( mapping-to-reference->summing up counts->looking at isoforms
) approach, and go directly to looking directly at counts along the
transcript path.  Again, this is something that Kallisto and Salmon
also enable, but there's a lot of unexplored territory here.

We've implemented a simple, short script to explore this here -- see
`explore-isoforms-assembled.py
<https://github.com/dib-lab/2015-khmer-wok3-counting/blob/master/explore-isoforms-assembled.py>`__,
which correctly picks out the exon boundaries from three simulated
transcripts (try running it on 'simple-mrna.fa').

Other thoughts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* these counting approaches can be used directly on metagenomes as
  well, for straight abundance counting as well as analysis of strain
  variation.  This is of great interest to our lab.

* calculating differential expression on an *exonic* level, or at exon-exon
  junctions, is also an interesting direction.

  great discussion of where this can go in the future (allele specific
  expression being one very promising direction).
