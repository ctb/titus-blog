I am very, very happy to announce that I have been selected to be one
of `the fourteen Moore Data Driven Discovery Investigators
<http://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery/investigators>`__.

`This is a signal investment by the Moore Foundation
<http://www.moore.org/newsroom/press-releases/2014/10/02/the-gordon-and-betty-moore-foundation-selects-awardees-for-$21-million-in-grants-to-stimulate-data-driven-discovery>`__
into the burgeoning area of data-intensive science, and it is quite a
career booster.  It will provide my lab with $1.5m over a period of 5
years, enabling us to dive into certain aspects of infrastructure
building that we would otherwise be unable to support.  I'm also
particularly enthusiastic about the implicit recognition of our
efforts in open science, open source, and replicability!

My talk and proposal for the competition are linked here:
