Anticipated FAQ:

* **Why?** `I'm moving to UC Davis <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-going-to-davis.html>`__.

* Do you have an employment contract with UC Davis?? Nope. But I'm
  starting there in January, anyway.  Or that's the plan. And yes,
  `that's how this kind of thing happen
  <http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/world/middleeast/professors-angry-tweets-on-gaza-cost-him-a-job.html>`__.
  I'm carefully refraining from geopolitical commentary on Twitter at
  the moment :).

* **Do you have tenure there?** Nope. Wheels are still turning.

* **Aren't you nervous about that?** Not really. Even if I don't get
  tenure, they've promised to hire me.  And if that doesn't work out,
  someone will hire me... right? Guys? Guys? Why did it go silent all
  of a sudden?

* **Why didn't you use 'I am hereby...' at the beginning?** I don't
  know, seemed pretentious.
